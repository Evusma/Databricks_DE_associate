In the repo, there are some questions and notes that helped me for the preparation of the Databricks Data Engineer Associate Certification.

The questions have been taken from different websites and some answers might be wrong. 

Copilot has been used to explain the answers of some questions, but stil I cannot guarantee that it's 100% correct (at the end of the day, copilote response is just probability, right?).
